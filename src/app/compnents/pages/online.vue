        <h2>Online GMAT Test Prep – For Students of All Levels</h2>
        <p>
         Whether you’re just taking your first steps in exploring the GMAT exam or looking for specific guidance in quant and verbal tutoring, you’ve come to the right place! We have a proven track record of helping students excel in the quantitative, verbal, integrated reasoning, and analytical writing GMAT sections.
Five years ago, we introduced online GMAT tutoring, and it has been a great success. For many of our students who work full-time, this provided some much-needed flexibility. And while we love for students to visit our Manhattan office, we understand commuting can be time-consuming.
We connect with our students either through Skype, Google Chat, or Zoom, where screen-sharing options are available. We connect an Ipad to our computer, enabling us to write out equations and solve problems in front of you. As far as homework and session problems, we provide students with access to our GMAT questions and answers database. Better still, we allow our students to record all of our sessions so that they can review anytime.

<h2>Why Use a GMAT Tutor</h2>

    <p>Our goal as GMAT tutors is to get you the highest GMAT score possible in the shortest amount of time. That means guiding students on how to allocate studying time to maximize progress. At GMAT Tutor NYC, we have spent over four-decades identifying and creating both the best GMAT strategies and the best techniques. Thousands of our students have applied our approaches with resounding success, with many students scoring within the top GMAT percentiles.
There are two main ways in which we prepare our students: by enhancing their technical skills and strengthening their test-taking skills. More on this below, but we have a particular way we teach the technical skills. We begin with the fundamental concepts, and once students are proficient, they graduate on to learn our

advanced techniques. Our advanced GMAT techniques are the most effective because they solve highly complex equations quickly, much faster than traditionally taught methods.
In addition to needing technical ability, students need stamina, focus, and confidence (test-taking skills). Our GMAT tutoring sessions are hyper-focused, not only because it helps students learn but also to build their endurance. We frequently administer real GMAT practice tests, which gauge students’ progress while also building stamina. Moreover, we relentlessly assign real GMAT practice questions for homework so that when our students take the exam, they can do so with confidence, knowing that every problem will be similar to ones previously encountered.

        <h2>The Student Journey</h2>
        <p>
          All of our students first take a short-assessment from which we develop a curriculum. For all of the quant GMAT topics, we have created two “special” problem sets, which we train our students on, “fundamental concepts”, and “advanced strategies.” Both of these sets are comprised solely of real GMAT practice questions. The fundamentals are questions below 650 that test root concepts, whereas the advanced are all problems beyond 700 with heavy testing on reasoning.
We teach our proprietary techniques once students can complete our fundamental concept sets with 95% accuracy using traditional methods. We insist on the
traditional methods first because, without a proper understanding of the base concepts, students will not know how or when to apply our proprietary techniques. Our advanced strategy sets are where students gain exposure to different problem types and can practice applying our techniques. By the time students can complete these advanced strategy sets with 95% accuracy, they are in good shape for the real GMAT exam. Further still, after completing our advanced strategies, students train on one last “special” set, consisting of the most routinely tested problems on the Official GMAT test.

        <h2>Over 20,000 GMAT Practice Questions</h2>
        <p>
        GMAT practice questions are at the heart of successful preparation. The GMAT Official Guide is a great resource, except that there are not enough problems. We have been collecting and creating GMAT problems for the past four decades and have developed our very own database. It is not an exaggeration when we say we have tens of thousands of real GMAT practice questions. All of our students’ train on real GMAT practice questions. Moreover, students can create custom problem sets for specific question-types and question-levels using our filtering options.
