          According to a 2019 study known as
          <strong> The Business School Hiring Report,</strong> the median annual
          starting salary offered to new MBA hires was $115,000, comparatively
          the median for new bachelor’s degree hires was $55,000. If you are
          considering pursuing your MBA, the GMAT plays an important role in
          determining your candidacy. Moreover, it is one of the few areas of
          your application, where you can still make significant changes. The
          average score for the top 25 MBA programs is 713. Meanwhile, the
          average time spent studying by the average GMAT 700 scorer is 120
          hours.

<h2>Why GMAT Prep with GMAT Tutor NYC?</h2>

    <p>The GMAT has been around for decades and is the most commonly taken exam for prospective MBA students. The GMAT is considered by some as a proxy for a student’s success once within an MBA program. Our attitude and philosophy towards GMAT prep are very different than most. There is a reason the GMAT is so prevalent, the skills it tests, such as reasoning, effective writing, and math competency, are foundational concepts needed for many of the subjects taught within MBA programs, and even beyond in the business world. Our GMAT prep is as much about getting you into the school of your dreams as it is about making sure that you succeed afterward. <br>
    Our GMAT prep focuses on developing three elements: technical ability, confidence, and stamina. The combination of these three elements is the key to success on the GMAT. Building technical ability has two stages, mastering the fundamentals, and applying our proprietary techniques. We ensure that all of our students have a solid foundation before learning advanced techniques. One of the main reasons for doing this is that without an intrinsic understanding of the fundamentals, it is not possible to use our methods reliably. Our proprietary techniques are, in many cases,
    alternative approaches that accomplish the same result faster than those traditionally taught.
    <br>
     Confidence comes naturally, as students see improvement. However, we further bolster our student’s confidence by training them on real GMAT practice questions. That means even when building foundational skills, students are still training on real problems and becoming acquainted with the GMAT format. Our goal is that by the time students take the real exam, they will have had exposure to every variant of every possible question type. In this way, students can have confidence in knowing that every problem on the real GMAT exam will be familiar to ones already experienced in practice.
     <br>
     Stamina is the third, and often over looked element needed for success. We structure our GMAT tutoring sessions to be hyper-focused, not only because it maximizes student’s time, but also because it builds mental endurance. Students also continue practicing outside of class on the homework problems we assign. Also, every few weeks, we provide students with a GMAT practice test to simulate the real experience, as well as to get feedback to adjust their curriculum.

        <h2>Why Beating MBA Acceptance Rates Matters</h2>
        <p>
          For each new student, we administer a short assessment. This assessment will gauge each student’s strengths and weaknesses, and provide insight into which of the 20 GMAT quant topics need the most attention. The results of this assessment, along with personal input, will then be used to create a personalized curriculum.
          <br><br>
          The way our GMAT prep is structured is so that students train on problem sets consisting solely of real GMAT practice questions. We have categorized our problem sets into two types for each quant topic, “fundamental” and “advanced.” The fundamentals test root concepts, whereas the advanced questions are those that are testing reasoning and require more complex solving.
          <br>
          The fundamentals are for practicing the traditional approaches. We teach these because, to apply our advanced methods, students must have a complete understanding of traditional problem-solving. Our advanced methods apply different concepts and bypass steps traditionally taken, but to successfully use these methods requires knowing how they are amending and expediting the solving process.
          <br><br>
          Once students progress onto the advanced problem sets, we begin teaching our proprietary techniques. These techniques are what will set our students apart. The advanced problem sets are reflective of the higher-level problems, and once students can complete these “advanced” sets with 95% accuracy, they are in good shape for the GMAT test.
          <br><br>
          However, before taking the exam, our students complete one final problem set. This set consists of the most routinely tested 700+ questions from all GMAT quant topics. Upon completion of this set, our students will have completed the last leg of their GMAT prep, and are ready for the real thing.
          <br>
          <br>

          Throughout this process,we give our students homework to complete outside of our GMAT tutoring sessions and provide frequent GMAT practice tests. We use the feedback from each GMAT practice test to monitor progress and to modify the curriculum of each student as needed.

        <h2>GMAT Tutor NYC’s Proprietary Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          We understand touting the efficacy of our proprietary techniques is bold. Other GMAT prep options even go so far as to say that there are no GMAT tricks and shortcuts that reliably work.We disagree, and our student’s results prove it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="imgSec3">
        <p>Our GMAT techniques were developed by taking concepts from engineering, math, and finance, and applying them to the GMAT. The reason these techniques work is that they perform the same function as the traditionally taught approaches, just faster. Math is a flexible subject, there may only be one right answer, but there are multiple ways to reach it. We have scoured academia to find the easiest routes to specific GMAT archetypes. And to be very clear, these are not answer picking short cuts or pattern recognition tactics. Instead, these are real techniques applied by various academic disciplines. We place so much emphasis upon these techniques because past the 700 level, saving time becomes even more critical as each problem requires more solving. Not only have we developed and tested these techniques, but they have been used with great success by thousands of our students.</p>

        <h2>The Database: 20,000+ Questions</h2>
        <p>
Having the right GMAT study material is critical for achieving a top result. If you have already started studying, you are undoubtedly familiar with the GMAT Official Guide. It is a great resource, with one caveat, there are not enough problems.
<br><br>
All of our students, even those just starting, are trained on real GMAT practice questions. We have been in the GMAT tutoring business for over four decades and have been collecting and curating the very best problem sets.
<br><br>
We recently created our very own database with over 20,000 real GMAT practice questions and answers. Students can even create problem sets customized by problem-category, problem-difficulty, and problem-type.

            In-Person vs Online GMAT Tutoring
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many students wonder about the difference between our in-person and online GMAT tutoring options. Candidly, the experiences are relatively the same. The main differentiator is students learning styles. Some students learn more effectively in person where they can visibly see everything, not just the board, and prefer a more tangible experience. However, as far as access to GMAT study material or taking of a GMAT practice test, all students receive the same access. We love meeting all our students, and for those who are so inclined, we welcome them to come to our Manhattan office located near Harold Square.
