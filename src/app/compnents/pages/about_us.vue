      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>  
      <p>When GMAT Tutor NYC was first established, founder Dr. Bob Chaparala understood the weight higher-education institutions placed upon standardized testing. From his own personal experiences, where he was constantly required to attain top percentile results for each program he attended, he understood the importance of having the proper mentorship and a clearly defined study plan. He also recognized and witnessed first-hand how the difference in even a few percentage points could alter eligibility for academic programs. Thus, his mission when launching GMAT Tutor NYC was to help students remove the anxiety, ambiguity, and stress out of preparing for the then-nascent GMAT exam, which he foresaw as becoming one of the main candidacy measures for MBA applications.
<br>

Over the last four decades, we’ve helped thousands of students excel in the analytical writing, integrated reasoning, quantitative, and verbal sections of the GMAT exam.
