            <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
            <p>f you are looking to score within the 600-700 range, this program is for you. This program focuses on mastering the fundamentals of every problem-type on both the quant and the verbal, and then taking it a step further by helping students to tackle the more complex problems. The main difference between this and our foundations program is that 1) we cover all the potential topics (in the 500-600 we focus only on the most commonly tested) 2) we provide advanced techniques to solve more complex problems 3) we teach the common problem-types that routinely appear in the 600-700 level range.
<br><br>
Many students seeking to score within the 600-700 range are already familiar with the GMAT and may have completed other GMAT prep programs. That’s absolutely fine, we will assess you and only work on the areas offer the most potential for improvement for you. For those of you who have not, don’t be overwhelmed, many of our students come to us starting from the beginning, the only difference is that it will take a little longer in terms of study time.

Success on the quantitative section is about being able to solve every problem. Particularly after the 600 level the GMAT loves to throw answer choice traps that can throw off other techniques. If you are able to completely solve each problem you will avoid almost all of these traps.
<br><br>

With that in mind, we begin with each student by reviewing the fundamentals of each GMAT topic. If you are already proficient in a topic we will move on quickly, but we always ensure everyone has a solid foundation first.
<br><br>
Once we have reviewed all the basics (knowing all of the formulas and being able to solve straight-forward versions of the problems) we introduce students to our advanced problem sets. For each of those GMAT topics we have an advanced set of problems which adds a layer of complexity. It is while going through these that we teach more advanced techniques. For each of these subjects we have shortcuts that will help get you the answer faster than standardly taught techniques.

<br><br>
Throughout this process we will also be going over approaches to data sufficiency. Data sufficiency can be tricky, but the same idea of being able to solve every problem applies.To be clear, you shouldn’t be solving data sufficiency problems, but you need to know if you could, and what information would be required if you were to. In particular, we will be teaching logical techniques to help you isolate what is really being asked on the data sufficiency questions.


<br><br>
As mentioned above, one final area we will focus on is the commonly recurring GMAT questions. For each section there are specific problem-types that commonly appear. And while it is not guaranteed that each of these will show up, if you are familiar with them you will encounter at least a few. Knowing these will give you an edge because you will be able to solve them quickly and reliably.


<br><br>

inally, one of the other largest benefits we provide to our students is our problem sets. We have various topics segmented by topic, question-type, and question-level. In this way you can focus on very specific skill-sets. Practicing on the right problems is crucial for your success.

                <p>

                    For the sentence correction, we focus on teaching the grammatical rules. If you know the rules you will do well. For the GMAT there are specific grammar rules that are consistently tested. Once the rules have learned on simple problems we introduce students to real GMAT problems. The difficulty of sentence correction is that the problems are deliberately complicated, so even a simple subject-verb agreement error can be extremely hard to spot. We will teach you how properly simplify and analyze the problems, ensuring that you don’t miss any errors.
                    <br> <br>
ritical reasoning the focus is on breaking down problems and understanding logic. The key to performing better at these problems is learning how to properly dissect them. From there is involves being able to identify and eliminate the incorrect answers, in contrast to how we teach students to handle questions on the quantitative section. In particular for the critical reasoning we will focus on bold-faced questions which appear more frequently at higher levels.
                    <br> <br>
In the reading comprehension section we will help students focus and pay attention to critical details while reading. This means being able to get a general idea of the passage while taking into account the passages structure, opinions and turns. Using this standardized approach will not only help you understand the passages, but also more easily answer the “main purpose” question that is frequently asked.
